/**
 * Programming is the act of constructing a program
 * provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
 * If you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the
    rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, 
    programming can be rewarding.
* One such language, JavaScript,is built into every modern web browser and is thus available on almost
    every device.
* This book will try to make you familiar enough with 
    this language to do useful and amusing things with it.

/*Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data,
modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be
mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus
fundamentally alike */

/*
-----------What is JavaScript environment ?
 To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost,
we must separate them into chunks that represent pieces of information.
In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values.Though
all values are made of bits, they play different roles. Every value has
a type that determines its role. Some values are numbers, some values
are pieces of text, some values are functions, and so on
